# Problem 1

### Homicide dataset

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown"))|> 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"))|>  
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") 
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (8): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_sex, city, stat...
    ## dbl (4): reported_date, victim_age, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

The tidy dataset has 52178 observations. Variables include the victim
name, race, age, and sex; the date the homicide was reported; and the
location of the homicide. `city_state` variable is created that includes
both city and state, and a `resolution` variable is created to indicate
whether the case was closed by arrest. The one entry in Tulsa, AL is
excluded because it is not a major US city and is most likely a data
entry error.

### Homicide status by city

``` r
city_homicide_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  select(city_state, disposition, resolution) %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"))
```

### Baltimore: unsolved homicide estimation

``` r
bmore_test = 
  prop.test(
    x = filter(city_homicide_df, city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
    n = filter(city_homicide_df, city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) 

broom::tidy(bmore_test) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>

### All cities: unsolved homicide estimation

``` r
test_results = 
  city_homicide_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(hom_unsolved, hom_total, \(x, y) prop.test(x = x, n = y)),
    tidy_tests = map(prop_tests, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate))
```

``` r
test_results %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

Chicago has the highest proportion of unsolved homicides among all the
cities.
